#### MVVM
**With my experience of MVVM , I figured out it  is better than MVC. Because of its**
- maintainability
- better decoupling  with ui views
- better encapsulation 
- better testing capability 
- can easily adopt for requirement changes

#### Boxing(wrapping)
**There are some ways to pass values from one place to another. Those are Protocols, Notifications, KVO, ReactiveCocoa and Boxing. Implementation of Boxing is easier than Observers.  It allows us to intercept change of property value.**

#### Realm over CoreData
**As I know Its too lengthy process behind the CoreData. Both are Relational DB tools but Realm is pretty easy to use.**
- we can build relationship between objects from the code
- Its faster than any other DB tools in mobile development 
- zero-copy architecture.
- Automatically update objects
